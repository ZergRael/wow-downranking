		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p id="introduction">
			With Classic coming up soon I've been feeling too exited to play any other game, and since I still have no key to the Beta, I decided to make better use of my time than drooling over Beta videos and streams. The result is a tool that will help players choose the most mana efficient healing spell ranks!</br></br>

			The rank selection is based on a <i>Healing Efficiency Score</i> (<b class="blue">HES</b>), which is derived from the combination of <i>Healing per Mana Efficiency</i> (<b class="blue">HPME</b>) and <i>Healing per Second</i> (<b class="blue">HpS</b>)</br></br>

		<h3>Using the tool</h3>
		<ol id="user-guide">
			<li>Fill out your total amount of Healing Power as shown in the in-game character pane</li>
			<li>If you have access to the Ahn'Qiraj spells, check the checkbox</li>
			<li>Select your class</li>
			<li>Fill out the talents to match your own talent points</li>
			<li>Select a spell</li>
			<li>A tooltip is now shown, displaying the recommended spell rank, and healing power breakpoints for that spell.</li>
			<li>(Optional) Drag the slider to change the importance of <b class="blue">HpME</b> and <b class="blue">HpS</b>. Dragging the slider to the far side of either end, will completely disregard the other attribute.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Calculations</h3>
		<p id="calc-intro">
			The Spell Coefficient (<b class="blue">SC</b>) is the factor that your Healing or Spell power is multiplied with in order to determine the final power of the spell. The way the <b class="blue">SC</b> is calculated depends on the nature of the spell, there are some general rules for how to calculate the SC, but as with all rules there are exceptions and a few spells such as Frost Nova and Lay on Hands, have their own modifiers.</br></br>

			The sections below will describe how this tool calculates Spell Coefficients, should you encounter any errors your are welcome to report a bug, or create a pull request. However, unless a reliable source is provided the requests will be rejected.
		</p>
		<h4>Direct spells and Over-Time spells</h4>
		<p>
			These two are the most straigt forward, since they are comprised of a single dividing factor.</br>

			Direct spells are spells that only have a direct impact such as <i>Smite</i>, <i>Shadowbolt</i>, Flash Heal or Healing Touch. The coefficient is calculated by:

			<code>[Direct spell coefficient] = [Cast Time of Spell] / 3.5</code>

			Over-Time spells includes both Damage over time (<b class="blue">DoTs</b>) and Healing over Time (<b class="blue">HoTs</b>), such as <i>Rejuvenation</i> or <i>Curse of Agony</i>. The added damage or healing is divided equally among each tick of the spell and the standard formula is:

			<code>[Over-Time spell coefficient] = [Duration of Spell] / 15</code>
		</p>

		<h4>Hybrid spells</h4>
		<p>
			Hybrid spells is a little bit more complicated, these are spells with both a direct effect and a Over-Time portion, such as <i>Regrowth</i>, or <i>Fire Ball</i>. The standard formula for hybrid spells is:

			<code>
				[Over-Time part] = ([Duration] / 15) / (([Duration] / 15) + ([Cast Time] / 3.5))</br>
				[Direct part] = 1 - [Over-Time portion]
			</code>

			The duration and cast time limitations are then applied:

			<code>
				[Over-Time coefficient] = ([Duration] / 15) * [Over-Time part]</br>
				[Direct coefficient] = ([Cast Time / 3.5) * [Direct part]
			</code>
		</p>

		<h4>Spells below level 20</h4>
		<p>
			Casting a spell that is below level 20 incurs a significant penalty to the coefficient of the spell. This was introduced during Vanilla WoW in order to counter the unforseen power of downranking spells a lot.

			The formula for this is:

			<code>1 - (20 - [Spell Level]) * 0.0375 = [Penalty]</code>
		</p>

		<h4>Putting it all together</h4>
		<p>
			Now when we have all the parts we can calculate the final effective coefficient for the spell which is defined by:

			<code>[Effective Coefficient] = [Basic Coefficient] * (1 - [Sub Level 20 Penalty]</code>

			Thus the actual power of the spell is:

			<code>[Actual Power] = [Base power] + [+Power] * [Effective Coefficient]</code>

			The result of the function above is what is used when calculating <b class="blue">HpME</b>, <b class="blue">HpS</b> and finally <b class="blue">HES</b>.

			The <b class="blue">HpME</b> and <b class="blue">HpS</b> are quite straight forward, and calculated as:
			<code>
				HpME = [Actual Power] / [Mana Cost]</br>
				HpS = [Actual Power] / [Cast time]
			</code>

			From these two we calculate the Healing Efficiency Score <b class="blue">HES</b> as:

			<code>
				HES = HpME^x * ln(HpS)^y 
			</code>

			with x and y changing depending on the slider.

			A few notes on this process:
			<ul>
				<li>All cast times are considered before any spell haste or casting time talents are applied.</li>
				<li>All talents or buffs that increase the damage or healing from spells are applied after the coefficient calculations.</li>
				<li>All DoT/HoT durations are considered before any duration buffs or talents are applied. Keep in mind that these talents simply add extra ticks of damage or healing for the same amount that the spell would do otherwise.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h4>Calculation example</h4>
		<p>
			As an example I will demonstrate how to determine the power of <b class="blue">Rank 3 Healing Wave</b> with 500 Healing Power.

			<code>
				[Base Power] = (129 + 155) / 2 = 142</br>
				[Basic Coefficient] = 2.5 / 3.5 = 0.714</br>
				[Sub Level 20 Penalty] = 1 - ((20 - 12) * 0.0375) = 0.7</br>
				[Effective Coefficient] = 0.5</br>
			</code>
			Which results in the actual power being:
			<code>
				[Actual Power] = 142 + 500 * 0.5 = <i class="yellow">392</i></br>
			</code>
